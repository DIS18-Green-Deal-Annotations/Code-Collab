     The roadmap sets out clear criteria for tree planting, counting and monitoring. It is supplemented by a website, a timeline for how additional elements will be developed, including a tree-counter, the ongoing development of the guidelines for biodiversity-friendly afforestation and reforestation and criteria for closer-to-nature forestry, and platforms for exchange of best practices.

     The roadmap includes a strong monitoring component, which will be essential to track progress for meeting the target. This will build on the expertise of the Commission and the European Environment Agency. Based on monitoring data, the Commission and the European Environment Agency will provide assessments of trends and the state of implementation. Synergies with technological solutions already in use, i.e. for air quality monitoring, will be sought in order to compile information on planting pledges at national, regional and local level.
